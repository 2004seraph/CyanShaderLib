# CyanShaderLib - My GLSL Shader Lib

Some basic classes made for my personal use to create OpenGL shaders easily in C++17. Use at your own risk.

## Building

This project uses CMake, you can convert it to a visual studio project to build it using the CMake-gui program, nothing weird should happen, I've tested it.
